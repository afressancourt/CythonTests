# Testing Cython

As I have struggled a bit to find a set of practical examples for Cython, I gathered some very basic elements I have encountered.

## Test 1: Compiling a .pyx fiel and using it in another Python file.

I have adapted the example from the - very good - _Cython: a guide for python programmers_ book from O'Reilly. I have simplified the example in chapter 4 to use a very simple "Hello world".

## Test 2: Compiling a .pyx file into a standalone executable.

Here, I have adapted the example from the _Embedding Cython_ (https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/EmbeddingCython) page. The Makefile takes the tes.pyx file and compiles a test executable.
